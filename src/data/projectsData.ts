        title: "Calashock",
        description: "My first project at Calashock was leading the development of their home website. I built it using WordPress and SCSS, focusing on creating a sleek, responsive design that would attract new clients and showcase the company's portfolio. As my first major project, it was a valuable learning experience in managing deadlines and communicating effectively with clients (Who were my employer). While I'm proud of the final product, in hindsight, I would have approached some aspects differently. For example, I would have challenged certain client requests, as some features were rarely used or quickly altered after launch. Additionally, I would have prioritized adding a dark mode option to reduce eye strain on the bright interface.",

This was a solo project of mine that I developed fully within 2 weeks.",

The website was in a direstate as unfortunately it was using a bigcommerce/wordpress plugin to connect the two, forming a headless solution where the wordpress would handle the navigation and functionality of the site and once the user checks out, it would lead them to the bigcommerce version of the site. There were many issues related to it that eventually caused the team to re-think their strategy for it. This project would eventually be re-worked into a bigcommerce project.",

The company specializes in cakes and everything surrounding it (Boxes, cake dummies, food colouring, boards, cards). I came up with solutions that helped speed-up the process of getting the site live and helped bring insight to the clients and even our own team as to why it was having certain issues with certain plugins. One of which was the search functionality, that kept mismatching the content from the filter.",

They just transitioned from one of their Wordpress sites and needed something temporary. Once that was done, they came back to us in 2022 and had us make them a proper bigcommerce website. This website was rather modular, allowing the user to slide and add cards from the UI on the admin panel to create content. This was an enjoyable experience and mimicked some of the tecniques used in React development.",

Usually senior developers don't do the development 'grunt' work as they serve better as leaders or guides for the mid-level developers, that's why I requested to work on this project. If you follow my timeline, you'll understand that I had just re-joined the company thus wanted to 'get back into the saddle'. This project was relatively simple and had no major deadlines in place. Therfore I could work on this while assisting other developers and getting use to the enviroment. The project was actually finished quite early but some features were not enabled through the payments of Bigcommerce. I let my superiors know of this but this ultimately led to the projects decline. I frequently requested updates on the issue but it was never pushed. It's a shame really, since I had the project 99% finished and that last feature was blocked by one 'company meeting'.",
